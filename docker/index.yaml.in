# TODO(CRAYSAT-1418, CRAYSAT-1449): Currently this is pulling the most recent
# stable version of cfs-config-util from arti.dev.cray.com. When sat-product-stream
# is compatible with the latest cfs-config-util, pull from artifactory.algol60.net
# (requires CRAYSAT-1418). Alternatively, use the last 2.x build published to
# artifactory.algol60.net (requires CRAYSAT-1449).
